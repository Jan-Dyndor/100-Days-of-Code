Alex had heard of these legends and was determined to uncover the secrets of the forest. One bright morning, with a trusty map in hand, Alex ventured into the depths of the woods, where sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick canopy of leaves.

As Alex journeyed deeper into the forest, the path diverged into two near small house. A signpost stood before him, weathered and ancient.
