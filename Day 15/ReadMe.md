# Day 15 - Intermediate - Local Development Environment Setup & the Coffee Machine

## What I have learned?

- I have learned about PyCharm, but I decided to stay with VS Code.
  I will read Angela's code and review mine. It is amazing how things could be done in a much simpler and more efficient manner. I am so excited to learn new things!
