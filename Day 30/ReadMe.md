# 270. Day 30 Goals: what you will make by the end of the day
What have I learned:
- JSON
Write json.dump()
Read json.load()
Update json.update()
- Exception handling 
    try:
    except:
    else:
    finally: 
    raise: 
If you can do something with if and else very easily = you should stick with that, if not and there is actually an error
by thrown and we do not have any other way of dealing with that use exceptions
