# Day 18 - Intermediate - Turtle & the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

When I want to use some module many times (more than 3) import it:
from module_name import class
name = class()

When I want to use same module one or twice:
import module_name 
name = module_name.class()

Module Alias 
import module_name as mn 
name = mn.class()

Some modules can not be imported, we have to download them and install form
Python Packages https://pypi.org/ or write normal import statement and PyCharm will help to install it 

I have also learned about Tuples.
