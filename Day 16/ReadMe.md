# Day 16 - Beginner - Higher Lower Game Project

## What I have learned?

- What is OOP and what ere benefits of OOP approach 
- When and how to use OOP 
In creating Object we have to think about what our object HAS (variables) = ATTRIBUTES and what it DOES (functions)= METHODS.
We call it a method because it is function that a particular object can do. We need an Object to do run those functions.

We can have a multiple Objects of the same TYPE. 
We have class, and we can have multiple objects of that class.

Defining Classes names we use PascalCase ex. CarClass()
(object) car = CarBlueprint()(class)
- I have also decided to try PyCharm. It is exciting to learn something new!
- I also learned how to integrate existing package of code into my project (https://pypi.org/)
To install packages: Files -> Settings -> Project we want some package ->  Python Interpreter -> + sign and we write what
package we want to install.
