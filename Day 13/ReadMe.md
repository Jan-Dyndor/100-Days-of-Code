# Day 13 - Beginner - Debugging

## What I have learned?

Finding and fixing bugs framewokrs:

1. Describe a problem - understand what program do
2. Reproduce the Bug - so you will understand when it happens
3. Play Computer - pretend you are a computer, read the code, imagine what will the code (you) do next
4. Fix the Erros -
5. Print is Your Friend - print things to maek sure when code breaks
6. Use a Debugger
7. Take a break
8. Ask a Friend
9. Run Often - run a code often. Do not wait untill you write a while bunch of code. Run code to confirm that even small changes work.
10. Ask StackOverflow or use different tool

## I have also debugged previous exercises like:

- Odd or Even number
- Leap Year
