# Day 21 - Intermediate - Build the Snake Game Part 2: Inheritance & List Slicing

What I have learned:
- Class Inheritance 
- Slicing (list, dictionaries)

Class inheritance 
class Fish(Animals):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

super() refers to Super Class - basicly initialize everything that Animal(super) class
has and do in Fish class
