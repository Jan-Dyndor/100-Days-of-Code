# Day 28 - Intermediate - Tkinter, Dynamic Typing and the Pomodoro GUI Application
I made a Pomodor Application from scratch and :
- Learned about Canvas Widgets
- Python Dynamic Typing :
We can change a variable DataType by changing its content
a = "Hello" (string)
a = 3 (int)
Python is stringy typed for example in functions - we cant use pow("hello")
because that function is expecting a number 

But Python is also dynamically typed - we can change variables type as shown above
