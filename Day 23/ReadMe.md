# Day 23 Goals: what you will make by the end of the day
I tried to make that game all by my self. I have been using only Steps 1 and 2 to complete the project. 
I believe I have succeeded.
The game is not perfect, it has some bugs like: 
- The car object is 20x40, but I measure it like square 20x20 in order to find out if the player hit a car.

I know many things could be done differently, better in case of performance and code readability, but I am proud of myself. 
I have learned a lot!
