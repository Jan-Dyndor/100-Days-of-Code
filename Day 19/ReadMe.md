Day 19 - Intermediate - Instances, State and Higher Order Functions

What I have learned: 
- Turtle Graphics 
- Event Listeners 
- State and multiple instances 

When we use functions s an argument (something that is passed to another function
we do not close function with parenthesis )
ex. def func1(fun2)

We can have a bunch of Instances od an object and every of them can have a different state.
